Android Camera Util
===================

It seems to be the simplest thing in the world: taking a picture within your Android app using the default camera activity. However, there are many pitfalls which are covered in several posts across the web as, for instance, null intents being passed back, the orientation of the picture not being correct or OutOfMemoryErrors. Finally, I managed to get it working on a wide variety of devices (see list below) and I wanted to share my solution with you. The code is partially based on the following posts:

* [Camera Force Closing issue in Samsung Galaxy S3 version 4.1.1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14495304/camera-force-closing-issue-in-samsung-galaxy-s3-version-4-1-1)
* [Null Intent passed back On Samsung Galaxy Tab](http://kevinpotgieter.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/null-intent-passed-back-on-samsung-galaxy-tab/)

I tried hard to avoid implementing different strategies based on the device configuration (e.g. manufacturer, model, ...). Unfortunately, I did not get around it. Going through hundreds of posts and talking to several developers, nobody found a solution that works on all devices without implementing device configuration specific code.


The code was _successfully_ tested on the following devices with Android API-Level >= 8 and stock Android.

* HTC Desire S
* HTC Desire X

Please feel free to check out the code. [CameraIntentHelperActivity](https://github.com/ralfgehrer/AndroidCameraUtil/blob/master/src/de/ecotastic/android/camerautil/lib/CameraIntentHelperActivity.java) provides the main functionality.

[TakePhotoActivity](https://github.com/ralfgehrer/AndroidCameraUtil/blob/master/src/de/ecotastic/android/camerautil/example/TakePhotoActivity.java) is an example Activitiy on how to use the CameraIntentHelperActivity.
